## Demo for Reviewer SkVi

You asked for an online demo. I would like to provide our developed online demo but due to the ACL Anonymity Policy, we provide this anonymized link which contains two videos of our demo together with our source code of GitAgent and GitBench dataset. One (`video/online_demo.mp4`) is the record of our developed online demo and the other (`video/cli_demo.mp4`) is the CLI version. We masked part of the CLI demo to guanantee anonymity.

## Case for Reviewer Ukyf

GitAgent is inherently designed to search for open-domain repositories on GitHub without any constraints to a predefined set of repositories. And the evaluation of GitAgent's capabilities is not confined to the 21 repositories within GitBench. The two cases of `U-Net` we mentioned are under `Case_UNet`.

Gitbench is at `dataset`, source code is at `code`.
